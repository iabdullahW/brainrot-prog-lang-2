# Brainrot VSCode Extension

## ü§î What is Brainrot?

**Brainrot** is a meme-inspired programming language that translates common programming keywords into internet slang and meme references. This VSCode extension provides syntax highlighting and basic language support for Brainrot files (`.brainrot`).

### Example:

```brainrot
skibidi main {
    yapping("Hello, World!");
    bussin 0;
}
```

In Brainrot:

- `skibidi` is equivalent to `void`
- `rizz` is equivalent to `int`
- `bussin` is equivalent to `return`
- And much more...

## üõ† Features

This extension adds:

- Syntax highlighting for Brainrot language keywords, operators, and built-in functions.
- File association for `.brainrot` files.
- Basic language configuration (comments, brackets, etc.).

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iabdullahW/brainrot-prog-lang-2.git
   cd brainrot-vscode-support
   ```

2. Open the project in VSCode:

   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. Press `F5` to launch a new VSCode window with your extension loaded.

4. Create or open a `.brainrot` file to see syntax highlighting in action.

## üíª Usage

After following the installation steps, you can start writing Brainrot code in any file with a `.brainrot` extension. VSCode will automatically apply syntax highlighting for recognized keywords and operators.
